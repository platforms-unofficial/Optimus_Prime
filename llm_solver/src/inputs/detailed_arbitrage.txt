Labor Arbitrage Optimization Problem

Business Context
A technology company is looking to optimize their global workforce allocation to minimize total labor costs while maintaining operational effectiveness. The company has identified multiple roles that need to be filled and several potential global locations where they could establish operations.
The challenge is to determine the optimal assignment of roles to geographical locations, considering factors such as:

Labor cost differences across regions
Local talent availability and quality
Time zone compatibility for collaboration
Infrastructure requirements
Communication needs
Setup costs for new locations
Required headcount for the various roles

Filled roles are integer values as we cannot have fractional employees.

The json file of data can be loaded from 'src/data/labor_arbitrage_data.json'
For the provided data, the solver should analyze the data provided and identify opportunities such as:

Key fields in the json are:

Roles 

Required Headcount: Number of employees needed for each role
Skill Level Required: Technical complexity (1-5 scale)
Remote Work Compatibility: How well the role works remotely (1-5 scale)
Communication Intensity: Level of collaboration needed (1-5 scale)
Time Zone Sensitivity: Need to work during business hours (1-5 scale)

Locations 

Cost Multiplier: Relative labor cost compared to base location
Talent Availability: Local skill pool quality (1-5 scale)
Infrastructure Quality: Technology and business infrastructure (1-5 scale)
Time Zone Offset: Hours difference from headquarters
Language Compatibility: English proficiency level (1-5 scale)
Maximum Capacity: Maximum employees supportable at location
Setup Cost: One-time cost to establish operations

Additional Parameters

Cost Matrix: Annual salary for each role-location combination
Compatibility Matrix: How well each role fits each location (1-5 scale)
Base Salaries: Baseline annual compensation by role

Annual salary costs by location
Setup costs
Total cost savings vs. all-domestic scenario

Utilization Metrics: Capacity utilization by location
Risk Assessment: Time zone coverage, skill concentration, etc.

Success Metrics

Cost Reduction: Percentage savings compared to base case (all roles in HQ location)
Feasibility: All constraints satisfied
Risk Balance: Reasonable geographic distribution
Operational Viability: Appropriate time zone coverage for critical functions

Test Scenarios

Base Case: Unconstrained cost minimization
Quality Constrained: Add minimum compatibility and infrastructure requirements
Time Zone Constrained: Enforce business hours overlap requirements
Capacity Limited: Reduce maximum capacity at low-cost locations
Mixed Objectives: Balance cost vs. risk (multi-objective optimization)

Sample Expected Output
For the provided sample data, the solver should identify opportunities such as:

Moving Customer Support and QA Testing to Philippines/India (low cost, high compatibility)
Keeping Product Managers and critical engineering roles in US (high collaboration needs)
Establishing mid-cost locations like Poland for roles requiring European time zone coverage
Optimizing between setup costs and ongoing salary savings

The optimal solution should achieve cost reduction while maintaining operational effectiveness.
