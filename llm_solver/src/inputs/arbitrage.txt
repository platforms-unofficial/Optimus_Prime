A technology company is looking to optimize their global workforce allocation to minimize total labor costs while maintaining operational effectiveness. The company has identified multiple roles that need to be filled and several potential global locations where they could establish operations.
The challenge is to determine the optimal assignment of roles to geographical locations, considering factors such as:

Labor cost differences across regions
Local talent availability and quality
Time zone compatibility for collaboration
Infrastructure requirements
Communication needs
Setup costs for new locations
Required headcount for each role must be satisfied

CRITICAL:
The sum of each role across locations must add up to the required headcount.
All roles must be filled.

For the provided data, the solver should analyze the data provided and identify opportunities such as:

Moving Customer Support and QA Testing to Philippines/India (low cost, high compatibility)
Keeping Product Managers and critical engineering roles in US (high collaboration needs)
Establishing mid-cost locations like Poland for roles requiring European time zone coverage
Optimizing between setup costs and ongoing salary savings

The optimal solution should achieve cost reduction while maintaining operational effectiveness.

Your MUST handle ALL role-location combinations (10 roles Ã— 7 locations).
Do not simplify by implementing only a subset of problem.
